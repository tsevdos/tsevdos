# 👋 Hello there,

I'm John Tsevdos, a software engineer from Athens, Greece (🇬🇷), and huge fan of full-stack [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (mostly [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) nowadays), [React](https://reactjs.org/) (and its ecosystem), [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and [Serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing). I'm a lead member of the [React 2 React Athens MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/react-to-react-athens-meetup/) and I'm sharing my JavaScript and React knowledge at [Code.Hub](https://www.codehub.gr/codelearn/our-instructors/) and [devotees.io](https://devotees.io/)!

If you want to learn more about me, feel free to visit my personal site **[tsevdos.me](https://tsevdos.me/)**!
